The functionality is here, but the game play is a little amiss.

To test effects not seen press R

To force to the next level press Q then the "start level" button for level two, press W and then the "start level" button for level three.

The server and high scores do work but we don't have a score to pass it.

To place towers, it is not click and drag, but click tower button then click on play area.
